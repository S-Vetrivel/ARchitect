# Nebula: Master the Physics of the Cosmos 🌌🚀

**Nebula** is an immersive, interactive Augmented Reality experience designed for the Swift Student Challenge. It blends spatial computing with astrophysical education, allowing users to build, simulate, and understand the mechanics of the universe—from the birth of a star to the complex engineering of orbital outposts.

## 🏗️ The Vision
Understanding spatial relationships and physics in 3D can be challenging. **Nebula** bridges this gap by turning your physical environment into a celestial drafting table. Using a high-tech "Blueprint" aesthetic, users don't just watch simulations—they engineer them.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Blueprint Hud Evolution**: A sleek, frosted-glass interface providing real-time orbital data and tactical overviews.
- **Telemetry Console**: A live session editor that allows users to modify the AR environment's properties—like gravity, orbit speed, and material types—using Swift-like syntax.
- **22 Progressive Missions**: A comprehensive curriculum spanning 5 distinct categories of spatial and physical mastery.
- **Realistic Physics Engine**: Powered by RealityKit, featuring complex orbital mechanics, linear impulses, and collision dynamics.
- **Haptic Immersion**: Integrated `CoreHaptics` provides tactile feedback for celestial events, enhancing the sense of presence.
- **Cinematic Experience**: Smooth transitions and an evocative "Nebula" design system that makes learning feel like a sci-fi journey.

## 🎓 The Curriculum

The experience is divided into five thematic categories, each introducing deeper concepts of AR and Physics:

### 1. Stellar Genesis (Levels 1–5)
*Foundations of spatial anchoring and object instantiation.*
- **Starbirth**: Initializing spatial anchors and G-type stars.
- **Goldilocks Zone**: Calculating habitable distances.
- **Orbital Mechanics**: Establishing stable gravitational paths.

### 2. Force & Motion (Levels 6–10)
*Advanced kinematics and energy states.*
- **Singularity**: Managing high-mass gravitational wells.
- **Kinetic Strike**: Implementing linear impulses and impact physics.
- **Deflector Shields**: Collision detection and reactive boundaries.

### 3. Engineering (Levels 11–15)
*Complex structural assembly in 3D space.*
- **Orbital Outpost**: Multi-component spatial parent-child hierarchies.
- **Space Dock**: Precision snapping and alignment in AR.
- **Debris Sweep**: Procedural object generation and cleanup.

### 4. Advanced Systems (Levels 16–20)
*Interpreting environmental data and complex simulations.*
- **Neutron Core**: High-energy particle simulations.
- **Fleet Deploy**: Managing large-scale entity systems.
- **Ring Worlds**: Creating massive, procedurally animated structures.

### 5. Mastery (Levels 21–22)
*The final trials of a Cosmic Architect.*
- **Nebula's Trial**: A timed challenge combining all learned concepts.
- **Universe Sandbox**: A free-form creative mode to build your own solar systems.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- **RealityKit & ARKit**: Utilizes `ARWorldTrackingConfiguration` for world-scale tracking and `Entity` components for high-performance 3D rendering.
- **SwiftUI**: A custom-built "Nebula" design system using `ultraThinMaterial` and advanced animations.
- **Physics**: Leverages `PhysicsBodyComponent` and `CollisionComponent` for realistic interactions.
- **Swift 6**: Built using the latest Swift features for safety and performance.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open `Nebula.swiftpm` in **Swift Playgrounds 4.4+** or **Xcode 15+**.
2. Run the project on an **AR-capable iPad or iPhone** (iPad Pro with LiDAR recommended for best experience).
3. Tap **"LAUNCH MISSION"** to initialize the Nebula Protocol.
4. Follow the HUD objectives to progress through the curriculum.
