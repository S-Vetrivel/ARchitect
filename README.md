# ARchitect Academy 🏗️📐

**ARchitect Academy** is an interactive, level-based ARKit learning experience designed for Swift Playgrounds. Transition from a "Zero to Hero" AR Developer by building, designing, and understanding the core principles of Augmented Reality.

## 🌟 Features

- **Architectural Aesthetic**: A professional blueprint-themed interface with high-tech grid visualizations.
- **Interactive Curriculum**: 5 progressive lessons teaching core ARKit & RealityKit concepts.
- **Real-time Code Snippets**: View the actual Swift code powering every AR interaction on-the-screen.
- **Cinematic Transitions**: Seamless flow between technical learning and immersive AR experiences.

## 🎓 The Curriculum

### 1. Foundations
Discover how ARKit detects the physical world. Learn to scan for horizontal planes and anchor virtual objects using `ARWorldTrackingConfiguration` and `AnchorEntity`.

### 2. Interaction & Materials
Master the art of selection. Use raycasting to detect virtual objects and manipulate their appearance using `SimpleMaterial`.

### 3. Physics & Gravity
Bring weight to your world. Implement `PhysicsBodyComponent` and `CollisionComponent` to make objects react to gravity and surfaces.

### 4. Forces & Dynamics
Learn about motion and energy. Apply linear impulses to projectiles to create dynamic, interactive scenes.

### 5. World Space UI
Bridge the gap between 2D and 3D. Learn to generate `MeshResource` text and anchor it precisely in physical space.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **SwiftUI**: Responsive overlay system and sleek transitions.
- **RealityKit**: High-performance 3D rendering and physics engine.
- **ARKit**: Advanced spatial awareness and plane detection.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open `ARchitect.swiftpm` in **Swift Playgrounds** or **Xcode**.
2. Tap **"INITIALIZE PROTOCOL"** on the welcome screen.
3. Follow the guided instructions and explore the "Code Behind" to learn as you play.
